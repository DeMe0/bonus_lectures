This lecture will focus on the following: 

- creating the remaining API Gateway routes
- assigning each one a Lambda function
- implementing full CRUD  

## Prerequisites

- An AWS (Amazon Web Services) account
- A working API Gateway
- Working Lambda functions

### Adding Remaining CRUD Routes

#### RESTful Routes to CRUD Mapping

Since the gateway we are building will be specific to **/projects** we will make sure to follow the same **RESTful Routes to CRUD Mapping** schema we implemented in the previous unit.  This means associating **routes, methods and path params**. 

HTTP  | URI  | CRUD Operation | Controller | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:
GET     | /projects          | Read all _projects_ | projects-get | No
GET     | /projects/:id      | Read a specific _project_ | projects-show | No
POST    | /projects          | Create a new _project_ | projects-create | Yes
PUT     | /projects/:id      | Update specified _project_  | projects-update | Yes
DELETE  | /projects/:id      | Delete specified _project_ | projects-delete | No

### Seed Data

Let's import some data to use in order to return some real data via our routes.  The same seed data will be used later to populate the DynamoDB database. 


#### Projects GET Route

Open the **projects-get** route and click on **File > New File**.

Copy/paste the seed data into the file and then save the file as **projectData.js**

We should see the new file in the left pane.

#### Import And Return The Projects Array

As with all node projects the resource must be imported using the **require** keyword. Also replace any previous content that was assigned to **body** with the imported **projects** array. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/dbcOvGX.png" width=500>

Make sure to **Deploy** the new changes made to the Lambda function. 

### Testing The GET Route 

Let's test the route in AWS Gateway and confirm that it does return the data set.

<!-- #### Redeploy The API

Let's make sure to redeploy the API so that

#### Teesting Via Postman

Also make sure that the route also returns data via **Postman**.

## Working With Route Params (Resources) 

Let's take a look at the routing table once again and our focus will be on the following routes, all of which make use of a **path params**.  Using a **path param** provides us the ability to send data to the API via a route instead of the body. 

The intent of using **/:id** as the path param will be to target an item based on a specific database id.  This is exactly the same process that was used when we setup up our express routes. 

HTTP  | URI  | CRUD Operation | Controller | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:
GET     | /projects/:id      | Read a specific _project_ | projects-show | No
PUT     | /projects/:id      | Update specified _project_  | projects-update | Yes
DELETE  | /projects/:id      | Delete specified _project_ | projects-delete | No

### Creating A Path Param 

Since the path param is part of a route we will need to create a new **resource** and associate the corresponding **method**.  

Let's click on **Actions > Create Resource**.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SLbZETW.png" width=300/>

Defining the route as a **path param** requires that the **Resource Path** be wrapped in curly braces. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GmdxLhi.png" width=700/>

Once the route is created we should see the resources list updated to include the new route. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QJWb96G.png" />

Now let's add a  **GET** method.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3vzsQQ6.png" />

#### Testing The Route

Of course we should to test that the route works. The testing page now includes a reference to the path we just created.  Let's add some value and run the test to see what it returns. 

As we can see the test returns our original message, which is expected as we hard coded the message in the response body.

### Passing Path Params To Lambda

In order for the Lambda function to receive the value stored in the path param we need to configure the **Integration Request** to pass this value.  This flow is visible in the pic below where we can clearly see that the **Integration Request** passes data to **Lambda** and then **Lambda** passes it's response to **Integration Response**. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P4CoI8q.png" width=300/>

The **Integration Request** can pass the path param value to the Lambda function using **Mapping Template** 

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DXYIwVg.png"> -->

Open the **Integration Request** and in the **Mapping Templates** section let's do the following:

- Click the radio button: **When there are no templates defined**
- Click the **Add mapping template** and assign **application/json**
- Click the check mark to create the template

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UponVtN.png" />

#### AWS Documentation

It's as this point we will need to edit the template and need to take a look at the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-mapping-template-reference.html#input-variable-reference) regarding what this involves.  

If we take a look specifically at **input variables** we can see that the route retrieves the value of the path, query string or header using **$input.params(x)**.  


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/2RBQFCj.png">

In the template section let's add the following:

```js
{ "id": $input.params("id") }
```

**NOTE:** A mapping template is a script expressed in [Velocity Template Language (VTL)](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/apigateway/latest/developerguide/models-mappings.html).  We won't delve into this language any more than whats in the AWS documentation. 

### Updating Lambda Function

Back in our Lambda function let's update it to access the values that are now being passed to it from the API Gateway via the **Integration Request**.  

As we can see the async function is configured to accept a single **event** argument so let's console.log the event, as well as, return it in the response. 

```js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
    console.log('event', event)
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: event,
    };
    return response;
}
```

If we test the function using the lambda test we should see that it returns the values that have been passed via the test. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1lMlksx.png" />

In order for Lambda to console.log the path param value we will need the API Gateway to trigger the Lambda function.  But before we do so let's take a moment to look at the **AWS CloudWatch** service to see how it creates logs fo each triggered event. 

### AWS CloudWatch Logs

Many of the AWS services save their log information in a central service called **CloudWatch**.  We can access the logs for this specific Lambda function by clicking on the **Monitor** tab. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/78oMNUP.png">

Here we can see the log stream that have been captured by **CloudWatch**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CjnUqRM.png">

If we click on the first link in the list it will take us to the most recent logs captured for this service.  Here we should see the previous events from testing Lambda.

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hedrwrW.png" /> -->

### Testing Via API Gateway

Let's run another test via the API gateway and confirm that passes the id in the path params. We should see the following:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lr2dTCg.png">

If we take a look at the Lambda logs we should now see an entry where the console log for the event contains the id and value.

## Exercise - Create Remaining Routes And Update The Lambda Functions - 10min

HTTP  | URI  | CRUD Operation | Controller | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:
PUT     | /projects/:id      | Update specified _project_  | projects-update | Yes
DELETE  | /projects/:id      | Delete specified _project_ | projects-delete | No

#### API GATEWAY

- Add new **PUT** and **DELETE** methods to the **{id}** route.
- Configure them to pass the **id** to the Lambda function

#### Lambda
- Configure the Lambda function to return the id value


#### Testing

- Test the remaining routes using the **API Gateway**
- Test the remaining routes using **Postman**
