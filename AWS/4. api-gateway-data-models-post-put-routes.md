# API Gateway Data Models For Post & Put Routes

If we examine the routing table we can see that both the **POST** and **PUT** routes accept data.  This makes sense as  **POST** is used to create new items and **PUT** to updated an existing item. 


HTTP  | Resource  | CRUD Operation | Lambda | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:
GET     | /projects          | Read all _projects_ | projects-get | No
GET     | /projects/:id      | Read a specific _project_ | projects-show | No
POST    | /projects          | Create a new _project_ | projects-create | Yes
PUT     | /projects/:id      | Update specified _project_  | projects-update | Yes
DELETE  | /projects/:id      | Delete specified _project_ | projects-delete | No


### POST Route

Let's start with the **POST** route.  We will take the following approach to set this up: 

- configure the **projects-create** Lambda function to accept data it receives
- update the API Gateway to perform some form of validation
- configure the route to transform the data before passing it to the Lambda

### Lambda projects-create Function 

Open the **projects-create** Lambda function and let's make one edit to the incoming data to give it a **project_id** so that it's unique in the database.

#### Test Via Lambda

Let's perform a test using Lambda using the below JSON. 

```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
  "description": "Add project description here..."
}
```

 If not test has been configured than take a moment to create one and call it **newItem**.

If successful we should see the following:

#### Test Via API Gateway

Let's now test  **Post** method in API Gateway.  Simply copy/paste the above JSON into the **Request Body**.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W56zvXh.png">

Click on the **test** button and if this successful we should see all items returned, with the very first entry in the array being the project we just submitted.

### Adding Validation

Although this works it offers no way of validating the data received. So if the data sent is missing a **key:value** or includes a **new key:value** that we don't expect, Lambda will add it to the array regardless. 

Lets test this out using the following JSON and confirm this is the case. 

**Missing A Key**

```js
{
   "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
}
```

**New Key Introduced**

```js
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
  "description": "Add project description here...",
  "status": "active"
}
```



Although we could add some form of validation to the Lambda this would require require the Lambda function to do more than it needs to do.  We also must keep in mind that we paying for each Lambda execution including time and RAM so anything we can offload from the Lambda function would help reduce costs.   

It just so happens that this type of validation can be done in the API Gateway using **Model** and **Mapping Templates**.

### Standardize Data Using Models and Body Mapping Templates

**Model** are used to provide a standardize data structure that will then be applied via a **Body Mapping** template.   Let's create a new **Model** by clicking on **Model** from the left navigation and then **Create**. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Zuh0bJI.png" width=300>

Since this model will be used for project data let's name the model **Project** and give it a **Content type** of **application/json**. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/TwZCupt.png" width=600>


Below is the format we will use for the **Model**.  One thing to make note of here is that we have included a **required** key that denotes which keys are required in order to be pass this test and be passed onto the Lambda function.

```js
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "title": "Project",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {"type": "string"},
    "image": {"type": "string"},
    "description": {"type": "string"}
  },
  "required": ["title", "image", "description"]
}
```


</details>

### Apply Model Via Method Request

We will apply this Model to the **Method Request** associated with the **POST** route.  Here we will add the **Model** by clicking on **Add Model** and choosing **Project** from the drown down. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/K8l61hL.png">

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Dr9U6W8.png"> -->

Since this route will receive data via the body we also need to set the **Request Validator** to **Validate body** and click the **check mark**.

#### Testing The Model

Let's run another test via the API Gateway and confirm that the model does indeed enforce that those keys must exist in order to pass the data down the line. 

```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
  "description": "Add project description here..."
}
```

Try removing a key and let's see the validation in action.

```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
}
```

As we can see the API Gateway responds with the following:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SS0qitV.png">

Although the Model provides some degree of validation it does have the limitation of not being able to enforce new keys from being introduced. 

Let's confirm this by sending a new key.

```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
  "description": "Add project description here...",
  "hackerAttempt": "going to hack your system"
}
```

We should see the element returned including the new key:value added to the object.

### Apply A Body Mapping Template

In order for the API to ignore additional keys we can apply this same model as a **Body Mapping Template** in the **Integration Request**.  Creating the template is done exactly as it was done for path params. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OnklVrh.png">

<!-- Since we already create a Model we can choose that option here as well. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cYg1iSc.png" > -->

<!-- ```js
{
    "title": $input.json('$.title')
    "image": $input.json('$.image')
    "description": $input.json('$.description')
}
``` -->



Since we've already created a Model for this type of incoming data we can just choose that from the drop down.

#### AWS Documentation

As we can see it's added some code for use and the part were interested in is:

```js
$input.path('$')
```

This is very similar to what we used for capturing the path params:

```js
$input.params("id") 
```

If we take a look at the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-mapping-template-reference.html) we will see they are both included in the same section on **$input variables**.  

Let's take a look specifically at **input variables**. The description may seem a bit confusing but all we need to keep in mind is that it has access to the data that has been passed as JSON.   


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7SktWxE.png">

The only thing we need to do is replace the default placeholder values of **"foo"** with the following:

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PkCh8jE.png"> -->

```json
#set($inputRoot = $input.path('$'))
{
  "title" : "$inputRoot.title",
  "image" : "$inputRoot.image",
  "description" : "$inputRoot.description"
}
```

**NOTE:** A mapping template is a script expressed in [Velocity Template Language (VTL)](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/apigateway/latest/developerguide/models-mappings.html).  We won't delve into this language any more than whats in the AWS documentation. 

### Validating The Model and Integration Request 

Test the POST route via the API Gateway for each of the below JSON objects. 

**All Keys**
```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
  "description": "Add project description here..."
}
```
**Missing Key**
```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
}
```

**Unexpected New Key**
```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
  "description": "Add project description here...",
  "hackerAttempt": "going to hack your system"
}
```

## Exercise - Testing Via Postman

- Deploy the API to the **dev** stage leaving an appropriate deployment message
- Run the same tests via Postman


## Exercise - Add Validation To The PUT Route - 15min

HTTP  | URI  | CRUD Operation | Controller | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:
PUT     | /projects/:id      | Update specified _project_  | projects-update | Yes

#### API GATEWAY

- Assign the existing **Project** model to the **PUT** route
- Update the existing **Body Mapping** template in the **Integration Request** to include the model

**HINT:** you may need to add quotes around $input.params()

```js
 "id": "$input.params('id')"
```

#### Lambda
- Configure the Lambda function to update and return the new element 


#### Testing

- Test using **API Gateway**
- Test using using **Postman**
