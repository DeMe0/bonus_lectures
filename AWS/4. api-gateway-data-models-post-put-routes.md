# API Gateway Data Models For Post & Put Routes

If we examine the routing table we can see that both the **POST** and **PUT** routes accept data via the body.  This makes sense as we need new data to **POST** and some form of updated data in order to update an item using **PUT**.


HTTP  | URI  | CRUD Operation | Controller | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:
GET     | /projects          | Read all _projects_ | projects-get | No
GET     | /projects/:id      | Read a specific _project_ | projects-show | No
POST    | /projects          | Create a new _project_ | projects-create | Yes
PUT     | /projects/:id      | Update specified _project_  | projects-update | Yes
DELETE  | /projects/:id      | Delete specified _project_ | projects-delete | No

Let's configure the **projects-create** Lambda function to accept data it receives for a new project.

We will use the below JSON for creating a new new project. 

```json
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
  "description": "Add project description here..."
}
```

If we run a test for the **Post** method in API Gateway we can copy/paste the above JSON into the **Request Body**.

Click on the **test** button and if this successful we should see all items returned, with the very first entry in the array being the project we just submitted.

### Adding Validation

Although this works with very little configuration, by default it offers no way of validating the data being sent. 

So if the data sent is missing a key:value or includes a new key:value that we don't expect, Lambda will add it to the array regardless. 

Lets test this out using the following JSON and confirm this is the case. 

**Missing A Key**

```js
{
   "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
}
```

**New Key Introduced**

```js
{
  "title": "New Project",
  "image": "https://i.imgur.com/L9K6hli.png",
  "description": "Add project description here...",
  "status": "active"
}
```



Although we could add some form of validation to the Lambda this would require require the Lambda function to do more than it needs to do.  We also are paying for each Lambda execution including time and RAM and need to keep this in mind as well.  

It just so happens that this type of validation can be done in the API Gateway


### Standardize Data Using Models and Body Mapping Templates

**Model** are used to provide a standardize data structure that will then be applied via a **Body Mapping** template.   

Let's create a new **Model**.

Since this model will be used for project data let's name the model **Project** and give it a Content type of **application/json**.

Here is the format we will use for the **Model**.  One thing to make note of here is that we have included a **required** key that denotes which keys are required in order to be pass this test and be passed onto the Lambda function.

```js
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "title": "Project",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {"type": "string"},
    "image": {"type": "string"},
    "description": {"type": "string"}
  },
  "required": ["title", "image", "description"]
}
```


</details>

### Apply Model Via Method Request

Open the **Method Request** associated with the **POST** route.  Here we will add the **Model** by clicking on **Add Model** and choosing **Project** from the drown down.

We also need to set the **Request Validator** to **Validate body** and click the **check mark**.

Although there is some degree of validation using the model there is the limitation of it not being able to enforce new keys from being introduced. 


### Apply A Body Mapping Template

In order for the API to ignore additional keys we can apply this same model as a **Body Mapping Template** in the **Integration Request**.  Creating the template is done exactly as it was done for path params.

<!-- Since we already create a Model we can choose that option here as well. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/cYg1iSc.png" > -->

<!-- ```js
{
    "title": $input.json('$.title')
    "image": $input.json('$.image')
    "description": $input.json('$.description')
}
``` -->



Since we've already created a Model for this type of incoming data we can just choose that from the drop down.

The only thing we need to do is replace the default placeholder values of **"foo"** with the following:

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/PkCh8jE.png"> -->

```json
#set($inputRoot = $input.path('$'))
{
  "title" : "$inputRoot.title",
  "image" : "$inputRoot.image",
  "description" : "$inputRoot.description"
}
```

### Validating The Model and Integration Request 

Test the POST route using the following:

- API Gateway
- Postman


## Exercise - Add Validation To The PUT Route - 10min

HTTP  | URI  | CRUD Operation | Controller | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:
PUT     | /projects/:id      | Update specified _project_  | projects-update | Yes

#### API GATEWAY

- Assign the existing **Project** model to the **PUT** route
- Update the existing **Body Mapping** template in the **Integration Request** to include the model

#### Lambda
- Configure the Lambda function to update and return the new element (no need to update an element in the array)


#### Testing

- Test using **API Gateway**
- Test using using **Postman**
