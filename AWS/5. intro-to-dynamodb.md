This lecture will focus on working with DynamoDB and will over the following: 

- providing an introduction to DynamoDB
- creating tables
- adding rows of data

## Prerequisites

- An AWS (Amazon Web Services) account
- Working knowledge of Lambda and APIs

### AWS DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL Database and uses key-value and document database that provides the following:

- delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale
- it's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. 
- it can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.

Many of the world's fastest growing businesses such as Lyft, Airbnb, and Redfin as well as enterprises such as Samsung, Toyota, and Capital One depend on the scale and performance of DynamoDB to support their mission-critical workloads.

**Free Tier**

Lambda falls into the **Always Free** tier of services so lets take a look at their [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) page search for Lambda to confirm this is still the case.

Although DynamoDB is a free service we still must be conscious of when we exceed those limits otherwise we will incur charges.  We won't have to worry about that for our current use case but changes are applied based on either read or write capacity units.  In this case it's 5 per second.

It should be mentioned that cost is measured across all tables so the more you create the greater chance you have of exceeding the free tier.

### Creating A DynamoDB Table

Let's get started with creating our first DynamoDB table by clicking on the big orange button. 

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/lD1OpKf.png width=400/>

This takes us to the DynamoDB services page where we can create tables and manage the DynamoDB database.

Add a **Table Name** and **Primary Key**.  The **Primary Key**, like all databases, will be unique for each entry in the DB.

Here we will assign the **Primary Key** a name of **ProjectId** and of type **String**.

### Create A New Item 
<!-- 
When we first add a new item we will have to decide the name of the **Primary Key** which is almost always the **Partition Key**.  -->

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AxjGVug.png"> -->

Here is one of the project entries from the projectData.js file and we will use this to create our first entry. 

```js
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Instagram Quotes",
    "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jkeohan/image/upload/v1582134376/Screen_Shot_2020-01-30_at_8.57.12_AM_cnrvug.png",
    "description": "Add project description here..."
}
```

Clicking on **Create Item** we can assign the **Primary Key** a new value.  For the sake of simplicity we will assign the item a value of **project_123**.  Later we will use another means of creating a unique key but for now this will do.

Add now it's just a matter of **Appending** additional keys based, choosing a data type and the assigning a value.

Once complete the item should look like the image below.

Clicking on **Save** we should see our new item added to the DB

```js
{
    "title": "CSS Grid Image Gallery",

    "description": "Add project description here..."
},
{
    "title": "GA Press Release",
    "image": "https://i.imgur.com/V2BP6Nf.png",
    "description": "Add project description here..."
},
{
    "title": "Fashion Blog",

    "description": "Add project description here..."
}
```

<!-- ### Accessing DynamoDB From Lambda

Since we will be accessing DynamoDB in a Lambda function we will need to use the [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/).  Since we will be using the JavaScript version of the SDK let's take a look at that documentation. 


Here we can see that there is an option to use it in **Node** so let's click on that option.

The SDK however is already available in Lambda so no need to install it.
