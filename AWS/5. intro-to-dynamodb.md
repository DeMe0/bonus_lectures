This lecture will focus on working with DynamoDB and will over the following: 

- creating tables
- adding rows of data
- using the DynamoDB SDK with Lambda to perform full CRUD

## Prerequisites

- An AWS (Amazon Web Services) account
- Working knowledge of Lambda and APIs

### AWS DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL Database and uses key-value and document database that provides the following:

- delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale
- it's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. 
- it can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.

Many of the world's fastest growing businesses such as Lyft, Airbnb, and Redfin as well as enterprises such as Samsung, Toyota, and Capital One depend on the scale and performance of DynamoDB to support their mission-critical workloads.

**Free Tier**

Lambda falls into the **Always Free** tier of services so lets take a look at their [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) page search for Lambda to confirm this is still the case.  

DynamoDB is free but limited to the following:

- Max size limit for any entry is 400KB

### Creating A DynamoDB Table

Let's get started with creating our first DynamoDB table by clicking on the big orange button. 

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/lD1OpKf.png width=400/>

This takes us to the DynamoDB services page where we can create tables and manage the DynamoDB database. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6kMrAyL.png">

Add a **Table Name** and **Primary Key**.  The **Primary Key**, like all databases, will be unique for each entry in the DB.  

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AxjGVug.png" width=500>

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BPVzVtf.png"> -->

Here we will assign the **Primary Key** a name of **ProjectId** and of type **String**. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/lV90zBp.png">

Although DynamoDB falls into the free category if we exceed those limits we will incur charges.  We won't have to worry about that for our current use case but changes are applied based on either read or write capacity units.  In this case it's 5 per second. 

It should be mentioned that cost is measured across all tables so the more you create the greater chance you have of exceeding the free tier.

### Create A New Item 
<!-- 
When we first add a new item we will have to decide the name of the **Primary Key** which is almost always the **Partition Key**.  -->

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/AxjGVug.png"> -->

Here is one of the project entries from the projectData.js file and we will use this to create our first entry. 

```js
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Instagram Quotes",
    "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jkeohan/image/upload/v1582134376/Screen_Shot_2020-01-30_at_8.57.12_AM_cnrvug.png",
    "description": "Add project description here..."
}
```

Clicking on **Create Item** we can assign the **Primary Key** a new value.  For the sake of simplicity we will assign the item a value of **project_123**.  Later we will use another means of creating a unique key but for now this will do. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/rkQmCjm.png">

Add now it's just a matter of **Appending** additional keys based, choosing a data type and the assigning a value. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7B9Ngq8.png" width=300/>

Once complete the item should look like the image below. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/GDpAj76.png">

Clicking on **Save** we should see our new item added to the DB

### Accessing DynamoDB From Lambda

Since we will be accessing DynamoDB in a Lambda function we will need to use the [AWS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/).  Since we will be using the JavaScript version of the SDK let's take a look at that documentation. 


Here we can see that there is an option to use it in **Node** so let's click on that option. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/W2k5vY9.png" width=500/>

The SDK however is already available in Lambda so no need to install it. 


<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hjJqcuv.png"> -->

### DynamoDB Methods

Let's take a look at the documentation on how to work with DynamoDB by going to the [AWS Services SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/index.html) page.  There are currently 2 versions to choose from which we will do once we setup DynamoDB in the lambda function. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tnShsuv.png" width=700/>

#### RESTful Routes to CRUD Mapping

Let's revisit the **RESTful Routes to CRUD Mapping** schema. An additional column has been added to reflect the DynamoDB methods that we will use for each corresponding route. 

HTTP Method | URI (endpoint)  | CRUD Operation | Controller Action | DynamoDB | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:
GET     | /projects          | Read all _projects_ | projects-get | scan| No
GET     | /projects/:id      | Read a specific _project_ | projects-show | getItem | No
POST    | /projects          | Create a new _project_ | projects-create | putItem | Yes
PUT     | /projects/:id      | Update specified _project_  | projects-update | updateItem | Yes
DELETE  | /projects/:id      | Delete specified _project_ | projects-delete | deleteItem | No

### Get All Projects

Let's start with retrieving the item we added to the table.  Since the **projects-get** Lambda function is meant to return all projects that is where we will start. 

#### AWS SDK

Before we can access any of the AWS services we must first import the AWS SDK into the Lambda function. 


```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
```

The SDK provides access to many of the AWS services and we must now instantiate a new instance of service we want to work with, in this case DynamoDB.  

Working with DynamoDB requires that we define the **region** and **apiVersion**

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB({region: 'us-east-1', apiVersion: '2012-08-10'});
```

#### The Scan Method

The method we will use to return all items is **scan**. If we do a quick search for **scan** in the [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/DynamoDB.html) we should see the following:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CVWnqlE.png">

We can see that the scan method takes in a **params** object and a **callback** function. 

Clicking on it should take us to the details section on how to use the method.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WRRTWPW.png" width=500/>

This above example scans the entire Music table, and then narrows the results to songs by the artist "No One You Know" and for each item, only the album title and song title are returned. 


#### Working With The Scan Method

Let's create a **params** object and add a single key of **TableName** and assign it the value of our table name. 

```js
const params = {
    TableName: 'projects'
}
```

Let's pass in the the **params** object as the first argument and then a **callback** function. The **callback** will be either passed an **err** or the **data** from the scan. 

```js
await dynamodb.scan(params, function(err, data) {
    if(err){
        console.log('failure - err', err)
    } else {
        console.log('success - data', data)
    }
})
```

If we give this Lambda function a test run we should see the following error.  This is because nothing is being returned from the scan.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/T2OHYxw.png">

But if we look at the logs we should also see that none of the console.log output is there either. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/U6SfnGd.png">

<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bQAe7vz.png"> -->

This is because the **dynamodb.scan()** method is running as promise but it's not being resolved.  In order to resolve the promise we must include **.promise()**. 

```js
await dynamodb.scan(params, function(err, data) {
    if(err){
        console.log('failure - err', err)
    } else {
        console.log('success - data', data)
    }
}).promise()
```

Deploy the changes and run the test again.  It should fail once again but with an **AccessDeniedException** error.  

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/J7Xsynz.png">

This is because our Lambda function doesn't have permissions to read data from DynamoDB.  

#### Assigning Lambda Permissions To DynamoDB

Adding permissions to our Lambda function requires that we open **IAM**.  Let's choose roles and then search for all roles that contain **project** in their name.  

We should see a role for each of the Lambda functions we have created thus far. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8JbXmeD.png">

Clicking on the **projects-get-role** will take us to it's configuration page.  Click on **Attach policies** button. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3u3qvnO.png">


Here we will search for **dynamo** and we should see the following policies. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/tQDBoyH.png">

Since the lambda function will only need read access let's check off **AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess** and click **Attach Policy**.

We should now see that the Lambda role has the newly assigned permission.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NmTVCZT.png">

Let's run the Lambda function one more time to confirm that it has access to the data. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DRtoZ2D.png">

#### Formatting The Data

We can see that **data** returned via the callback is an object and that it has a key of **Items** that is assigned an array containing all of our projects.  Each key returns yet another object as it's value. 

Let's console.log the object stored inside the object keys so we can get see what it contains. 

```js
console.log('success - data', data.Items[0])
```

We should see the following.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/v0k3FbV.png">

So now we understand how the data is structured we can format it in a way that our front end expects to receive it. 

```js
const items = data.Items.map( (data,index) => {
    return {
        projectId: data.ProjectId.S,
        title: data.Title.S,
        image: data.Image.S,
        description: data.Description.S
    }
})
```

Let's also assign the **items** array to the **response.body**

```js
const items = data.Items.map( (data,index) => {
    //...more code
})
response.body = items
```

If we run one final test we should see the following:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0ZHAhSM.png">

### Projects-Get Lambda Solution 

Here is the final codebase for the lambda function. 

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB({region: 'us-east-1', apiVersion: '2012-08-10'});


exports.handler = async (event) => {
    
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
    };
    
    const params = {
        "TableName": "projects"
    }
    
    await dynamodb.scan(params, function(err, data) {
            if(err){
                console.log('failure - err', err)
            } else {
                console.log('success - data', data.Items)
                const items = data.Items.map( (data,index) => {
                    return {
                        projectId: data.ProjectId.S,
                        title: data.Title.S,
                        image: data.Image.S,
                        description: data.Description.S
                    }
                })
                response.body = items
            }
        }).promise()
        
     return response 
};
```

### Get A Single Project 

Open up our **projects-show** lambda function and add the following to so that we can work with the AWS SDK. 

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB({region: 'us-east-1', apiVersion: '2012-08-10'});
```

Just as before we will need to pass in a **params** object with the key:values needed to retrieve the item from database. 

Here we will include an additional **Key** parameter that will reference the column name.  It is also assigned a value as an object. 

```js
const params = {
    Key: {"ProjectId": { S: event.id } },
    TableName: 'projects'
    }
```  

According to the routing table we can see that thee DynamoDB method to use to return a single item is **getItem**

HTTP Method | URI (endpoint)  | CRUD Operation | Controller Action | DynamoDB | Has Data
-----------|------------------|------------------|:---:|:---:|:---:
GET     | /projects          | Read all _projects_ | projects-get | scan| No
GET     | /projects/:id      | Read a specific _project_ | projects-show | getItem | No


#### Formatting The Data

Let's setup dynamoDB to get a single item, format the data in a way the front end expects and then return that item in the body just as before.

```js
await dynamodb.getItem(params, function(err,data){
    if(err) {
        console.log(err)
    } else {
        console.log('success - data', data)
        const item = {
                userId: data.Item.ProjectId.S,
                title:  data.Item.Title.S,
                image:  data.Item.Image.S,
                description: data.Item.Description.S
            }
        response.body = item
}

}).promise()

return response;
```

#### Assigning Lambda Permissions To DynamoDB

If we test this we should receive the following error as this Lambda role hasn't been assigned the **AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess** policy. 

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/XxamPe4.png">

Based on how we previously assigned the role take a moment to do so now. 

Now perform the following tests to confirm that it works:
- Lambda
- Postman


### Projects-Show Lambda Solution 

Here is the complete solution for the Lambda function. 

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB({region: 'us-east-1', apiVersion: '2012-08-10'});

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    console.log('event', event)
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
    };
    
    const params = {
        Key: {"ProjectId": { S: event.id } },
        TableName: 'projects'
     }
               
    await dynamodb.getItem(params, function(err,data){
    if(err) {
        console.log(err)
    } else {
        console.log('success - data', data)
        const item = {
                userId: data.Item.ProjectId.S,
                title:  data.Item.Title.S,
                image:  data.Item.Image.S,
                description: data.Item.Description.S
            }
        response.body = item
    }

    }).promise()
    
    return response;
}
```
