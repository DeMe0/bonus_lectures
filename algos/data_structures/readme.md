## Prerequisites


## What is a Data Structure?

Data structures are used to structure data. But what does that even mean? I'm sure we all know that data is structured in some format otherwise how would we effectively store or retrieve information.  

So its easiest to think of it in terms of **organization**, as in how would you best organize a set of things. 

## The Need for Ogranizing Data

Let's take for instance the need to organize books.  I'm sure this is something we've all done in the past or have encountered when we've gone to a book store. 

### Approach #1

Books, similar to data, can be organized in many ways.  Let's imagine we are presented with a box of random books.  How would you organize them and what criteria would you use to justify any specific approach?   

One approach to organizing books is to do so in alphabetical order, either based on author or book title. The criterea we might have used to make this decision is that we want to find a or insert a book into the collection.  

### Approach #2

We might choose to apply an additional organizational structure such as organizing them first based on the genre of book.   Once again our criteria might be to provide the ability to browse books based on genre and/or visualize the quantity of those types of books in our collection. 

### Approach #3

One might choose to place them in the order based on when they were read. This would allow them to covey some type of sequence and perhaps reference a point in time in their level of education.
