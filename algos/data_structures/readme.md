## Prerequisites


## What is a Data Structure?

Data structures are used to structure data. But what does that even mean? I'm sure we all understand that things need to be structured in some format otherwise how would we effectively store or retrieve information.  

The easiest to think of it is in terms of **organization**, as in how would you best organize a set of things. 

## The Need for Organizing Data

Let's take for instance the need to organize books.  I'm sure this is something we've all done ourselves or have encountered at a book store or library. 

Books, similar to data, can be organized in many ways.  Let's imagine we are presented with a box of random books.  How would you organize them and what criteria would you use to do so?  Defining the criteria is an important step as our organization strategy will attempt to implement the most efficient design. 

### Approach #1

One approach to organizing our books is to do so in alphabetical order, either based on author or book title. The criteria we might have used to make this decision is that we want a way to easily find a or insert a book into the collection.  

### Approach #2

We might choose to apply an additional organizational approach such as organizing them first based on the genre and then based on author or title.   Once again our criteria might be to provide the ability to browse books based on genre and then on author or title. We might also have opted for genre as we would like to visualize the quantity of those types of books in our collection. 

### Approach #3

Another approach is to place them in the order based on when they were read. This would allow their order to covey some type of sequence in when they were read and perhaps what impact they had on that persons life at the time.
