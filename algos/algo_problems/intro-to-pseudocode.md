# Intro To Pseudocode 

As developers we often go through many stages, from getting an idea to reaching a valid, working implementation of it. This often requires developers to design an **algorithm**, apply it to the problem at hand, and then test it for various input datasets.

#### But What Is An Algorithm? ü§î

An algorithm is:
- A procedure for solving a problem in terms of the actions to be executed and the order in which those actions are to be executed.
- An algorithm is the sequence of steps taken to solve a problem. 

Here where pseudocode comes to the rescue. Pseudocode is a technique used to describe the distinct steps of an algorithm in a manner that is easy to understand for anyone with basic programming knowledge.

In your own words answer the question:**:question: What is an algorithm?**

#### Just How Important Is Good Pseudocode

When writing instructions for another human to perform a basic task we take into account certain assumptions and provide detailed instructions for where we know they are needed.  Let's take the following example.

##### Assemble A New IKEA Shelving Unit 

Assumptions:
- User knows how to open the box
- User knows how to remove objects from the box
- User knows to look for instructions
- User knows that twisting screwdriver right tightens and left loosens

Detailed Instructions:
- User must be provided the steps on how to assemble the parts in the proper order
- User provided diagrams for which parts to connect and which screws are used for those connections

## The Main Keywords Of Pseudocode

The core of pseudocode is the ability to represent programming constructs. These constructs ‚Äî also called keywords ‚Äîare used to describe the control flow of the algorithm.

- SEQUENCE represents linear tasks sequentially performed one after the other.
- WHILE a loop with a condition at its beginning.
- REPEAT-UNTIL a loop with a condition at the bottom.
- FOR another way of looping.
- IF-THEN-ELSE a conditional statement changing the flow of the algorithm.
- CASE the generalization form of IF-THEN-ELSE.

 ## Rules of writing pseudocode

 Since everyone who writes pseudocode does so in their own style or preference here are some simple rules that help make pseudocode more universally understood.

- Always **capitalize** the initial word 
- Have only one statement per line.
- **Indent** to show hierarchy, improve readability, and show nested constructs.
- Always end multiline sections using any of the END keywords (ENDIF, ENDWHILE, etc.).-
- Use the naming domain of the problem, not that of the implementation. E.g., ‚ÄúAppend the last name to the first name‚Äù instead of ‚Äúname = first+ last.‚Äù
- Keep it simple, concise, and readable.

### Examples:

Think about when you cross the street and all the actions that you take to make it to the other side safely.  

```text
WAIT for the light to turn red
IF all cars have stopped
  CROSS the street
ELSE IF some cars are coming to a stop
  WAIT for them to stop before deciding to cross the street
END IF

```

Problem: 
Evaluate all the student's exam grades, if the students recieved anything above 60 they passed otherwise they didnt.

```text
IF a student's grade is greater than or equal to 60
   RETURN PASSED
ELSE 
    RETURN FAILED
END IF
```

Problem: 
Find the class average of the student's exam grade


```text
SET a variable called total to zero
SET a variable called grades to one
SET a variable classAverage to zero

WHILE grades is less than or equal to totalStudents
    ADD the current grade to total 
END WHILE

SET classAverage equal to total / totalStudents

RETURN classAverage
```
<!-- 
```text
INTI a variable called passes to zero
INTI a variable called failures to zero
INTI a variable called student to one

WHILE student counter is less than or equal to ten
    input the next exam result
    if the student passed
        add one to passes
    else
        add one to failures
    endif
    
    add one to student counter
END WHILE

print the number of passes
print the number of failures

if eight or more students passed
    print "raise tuition"
endif
``` -->

## Some keywords that could be used:
For looping and selection refer to the following key words:

- DO WHILE..END WHILE
- Loop...END LOOP
- CASE...END CASE
- IF...END IF
- RETURN


Always indent scopes and end them with proper spacing, and/or end keywords

As verbs, use the words Generate, Compute, Process, etc. Words such as set, reset, increment, compute, calculate, add, sum, multiply, ... print, display, input, output, edit, test. Along with careful indentation tend to foster desirable pseudocode.





### Sequence
A series of instructions to complete one action and proceed to the next

Example:
```text
GET temperature value
GET weather type
PRINT ‚ÄúIt is <temperature> degrees and <weather type> out right now‚Äù
``` 

### If-Then-Else: 

A decision between two sequences based on some condition (NOTE: the indentation of the `then` and `else` sequences)
```text
GET num
IF num % 2 THEN
  PRINT ‚Äú<num> is even!‚Äù
ELSE
  PRINT ‚Äú<num> is odd!‚Äù
ENDIF
```

### While: 
As long as some condition is met, continuously run the same sequence (NOTE: the indentation of the while loop)
```text
DETERMINE buellerIsPresent
WHILE !buellerIsPresent
  PRINT ‚ÄúBueller? ‚Ä¶‚Äù
  DETERMINE buellerIsPresent
ENDWHILE
```

### Case: 
Like an if-else statement but matching on a particular value (NOTE: if we want our case statement to be comprehensive, we need to provide a DEFAULT case) 
```text
CASE temp OF:
  ‚ÄúCold‚Äù: PRINT ‚ÄúBetter stay indoors...‚Äù
  ‚ÄúCool‚Äù: PRINT ‚ÄúBring a jacket!‚Äù
  ‚ÄúWarm‚Äù: PRINT ‚ÄúEnjoy the sun!‚Äù
  DEFAULT:
    PRINT: ‚ÄúUnknown temp, You‚Äôre on your own!‚Äù
ENDCASE
```

### Repeat:
```text
REPEAT:
  PRINT ‚ÄúPete and Repete were sitting on a bridge. Pete fell off. Who was left?‚Äù
  GET userAnswer
UNTIL userAnswer != ‚ÄòRepete‚Äô
```

### For:
A for loop is just a specialized while loop that loops over elements of some collection
```text
GET limit
FOR EACH number up to limit
  IF number is divisible by 5 and 3 THEN
     PRINT ‚ÄúFizzBuzz‚Äù
  ELSE IF number is divisible by 3 THEN
    PRINT ‚ÄúFizz‚Äù
  ELSE IF number is divisible by 5 THEN
    PRINT ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù
  ELSE
    PRINT number
  ENDIF
ENDFOR
```

Using the pseudocode...
## Challenge1
Given a string, write the pseudocode function to check if it is palindrome or not. 
> A string is said to be palindrome if reverse of the string is same as string. For example, ‚Äúradar‚Äù is palindrome, but ‚Äúradix‚Äù is not palindrome.

## Challenge2
Function `VowelCount(str)` takes the `str` string parameter being passed and `return` the number of vowels the string contains 
> (ie. "All cows eat grass" would return 5).
